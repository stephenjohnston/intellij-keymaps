# intellij-keymaps

This keymap contains most of the standard intellij keybindings for Mac OS X 10.5+ alongside several commonly used emacs shortcuts.  Many of the emacs shortcuts did not clash with existing intellij shortcuts.  In cases where they did clash, I generally chose the emacs over the intellij equivalent and remapped the intellij shortcut to a new keybinding.

Place the keymap in ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea15/keymaps
